I have run this script for the last few years for myself. Here is a small library of malicious code that was scraped from Pastebin using PastaBean. Samples: Base64 PE and Powershell. These samples were collected from the public listings on Pastebin newest public 100 pastes every 60 seconds.

To get more information about each sample check hashes via Virustotal/any.run and other Threat intel platforms.

By downloading these samples you are doing so AT **YOUR OWN RISK**. It is your **RESPONSIBILITY** to handle and anaylse these samples safely and not infect other users.

I have not analysed most of these samples so if you find anything cool please send me an email or DM via twitter.
